# Engineer L3
> Level 3 is the most needed team member. It does not mean we will limit the growth to higher levels, but on this level, you actually contribute in main areas of productivity for a developer. 

*Same as L1, L2, but also...*

### Should have

* Successfully performed the role of an L2 at Socialbakers or equivalent role elsewhere
* Performed work that was evaluated to be done at ‘high quality’ by peers
* Demonstrated ability to collaborate well across teams
* Succeeded as an engineer when presented with projects of increasing complexity over time across multiple areas or domains of the code/product
* Demonstrated ability to unblock themselves and other team members
* Earned a high level of trust amongst team to own a task/project without needing much supervision
* Demonstrated ability to anticipate how contributions can affect larger architecture, developing risk mitigation and contingency plans
* A high level of understanding about where their work fits in and how to be useful and successful on their team
* A high level of craftsmanship about their work, the end experience of the user, and impact on overall product
* Demonstrated an open minded attitude to solutions presented by product and design and help to iterate and improve those solutions
* 

### Is expected to

* Be familiar with multiple areas or domains of the code/product
* Be able to dive in to any area of the code/product that they’re not familiar with & make changes, guide others in how to do this
* Show curiosity to not only learn new things but fully understand how they work
* Be highly productive - have a reputation for getting things done quickly and efficiently
* Be proactive in keeping codebase healthy
* Be a mentor for other engineers
* Make an extra effort if the team runs into crunch time
* Capable of identifying and communicating the problems to be solved
* Helping in breakdown of a problem into an executable action plan for themselves and other engineers 
* Consistently tie back a project to a team goal
* Actively participate in frequent code/design/architecture reviews
* Be able to communicate well with all engineers regardless of seniority
* Work across engineering teams (dev, QA, devops) to ensure new code launches smoothly and customer needs are met
* Monitor the outcomes of team’s actions to learn from mistakes and replicate successes
* Reach goals specified in education plan and successfully present them on engineering level
* Interview prospective candidates and provide thoughtful evaluations and feedback


### Practical examples
* L3 is present on value stream meetings and understand the outcome and plans
* L3 is helpful on feature refinements and planning meetings

### Red flags
* Fails to identify or communicate big roadblocks
* Us-vs-them attitude 
* Continually underestimates timelines
* Doesn’t take operational excellence seriously
* Solutions are more complicated than necessary
* Does not take sprints seriously and does not deliver promised value
