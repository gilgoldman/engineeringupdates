This repo contains a list of Socialbakers Engineering titles, roles, and associated responsibilities, also known as **The Ladder**.

  System is created as exception based, meaning that we don't assume that we have all-fitting people. Therefore, discussion about level is goal-based, not proof-based. For instance, we can say "*We see you nearly at Level 3, to get there, however, we need you to be more proactive in feature refinement meetings*". We can also mark some traits as exceptional in specific cases, such as "*You are a great solution architect and we don't expect that you will speak in public, despite it's described as a requirement at your level*".

  Core of the ladder is a system of levels for developers. At the moment, top level is level 4, which applies to the roles of an Engineering Manager and both Architect roles (these are different roles, not levels).

| scope/level    | Level 0 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 | Skills |
|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| delivery         |   ☆☆☆☆   |    ★☆☆☆    |    ★★☆☆    |    ★★★☆    |    ★★★★    | Scoping and prioritization, Testing and monitoring, Shipping to production, Initiative |
| domain expertise   |   ★☆☆☆   |   ★★☆☆   |   ★★☆☆   |   ★★★☆   |   ★★★★   | Knowledge of your discipline Knowledge of your discipline (e.g. web development, microservices, databases), Language, Tools, Business and product sense |
| problem solving     |   ★☆☆☆   |   ★☆☆☆   |   ★★☆☆   |   ★★★☆  |   ★★★☆   | Architecture & design patterns, Breaking down large problems, Critical thinking, Analytical skills, Creativity, Decision making |
| communication  |   ★☆☆☆   |    ★☆☆☆    |  ★☆☆☆   |   ★★★☆   |  ★★★★   | Documentation, Collaboration, Relationship-building, Interviewing, Listening, Empathy |
| leadership  |   ★☆☆☆   |    ★☆☆☆    |   ★☆☆☆   |   ★★☆☆   |   ★★★★   |Accountability, Responsibility, Mentorship, Making hard decisions, Setting an example |

  It's imperative to acknowledge that the ladder does not introduce a hierarchy. Responsibility for delivering a value is on the whole team - the goal of the ladder is to **establish a road for career development**, to set expectations and introduce topics to disuss in regular 1-1 meetings.

 The boundary of the ladder is the team. Since there are many differences in regard to how each team works and operates, needless to mention the level of knowledge, it would be difficult to make the levels same across the company.
 
 Therefore, we lay down the levels in a form of a team assesment. Team members make a peer assessment based on scopes decribed in the table above. Some higher levels are assessed by a members of wider team also, including PO and Architects.

  As an additional metric to the Ladder, we have a system of Badges. Badges will mark exceptional qualities not described in the Ladder, usually technical abilities such as deep knowledge of ElasticSearch, being an ambassador of BDD aproach etc.
